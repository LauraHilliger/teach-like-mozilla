Add nice generated captions to your book images. This plugin converts ```alt``` or ```title``` attributes of your
images into the captions. Works both in GitBook website and generated book (pdf, mobi).

##Online demo
â†’ http://tdvorak.gitbooks.io/test-book/content/phetchaburi.html

## Instalation
In your book.json add plugin like this:
```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "image-captions"
    ]
}
```

If you're building your book locally, download an prepare plugins simply by running: ```gitbook install```.

## Configuration
The plugin provides reasonable defaults and you don't need to config anything.
However there are two config values, you can use to adapt captions to your needs:

### Caption text

If you want to configure the caption text, you can provide your own template in the form:
```json
  "pluginsConfig": {
      "image-captions": {
          "caption": "Image - _CAPTION_"
      }
  }
```

The keyword ```_CAPTION_``` will be automatically replaced by the title or alt of your image
(the plugin uses first ```title```, if not found, then ```alt``` attribute).

### Text align
The image caption is by default aligned to the center. You can override this setting by providing config property ```align``` with one of the values:

- ```left```
- ```right```

This will align the caption to the left:

```json
  "pluginsConfig": {
      "image-captions": {
          "align": "left"
      }
  }
```

## CSS Styles
This plugin generates simple ```figure``` around your images:
```html
<figure>
    <img src="../images/phetchaburi.jpg" alt="Phra Nakhon Khiri, Phetchaburi">
    <figcaption>Image - Phra Nakhon Khiri, Phetchaburi</figcaption>
</figure>
```

You can then customize CSS styles of the ```figure``` and ```figcaption```. By default, this definition is included in the plugin:

```css
figure {
    margin: 1.5em 0px;
    padding:10px 0;
}

figcaption {
    clear: left;
    margin: 0.75em 0px;
    text-align: center;
    font-style: italic;
    line-height: 1.5em;
}
```
How to attach your own styles can you read on [help.gitbook.com](http://help.gitbook.com/format/configuration.html).

First, you have to create your own css file - for example ```website.css```. Then add
your definitions of ```figure``` and ```caption```. You can change the text align, colors,
borders and so one. Last step is to attach your css style to the book. Open the ```book.json```
config file and modify it to look similar to this:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "image-captions"
  ],
  "pluginsConfig": {},
  "styles": {
    "website": "website.css"
  }
}
```


Different styles can be attached for
web and books, so you can style the captions differently for every medium:

```json
"styles": {
  "website": "website.css",
  "ebook": "ebook.css",
  "pdf":  "pdf.css",
  "mobi": "ebook.css",
  "epub": "ebook.css"
}
```

The same should apply for the online book editor on [gitbook.com](https://www.gitbook.com).

## Under the hood
This plugin attaches itself to the "page" event of GitBook generate task. It receives rendered HTML page of the chapter.
Then the plugin goes through the HTML code of the page, searching for images. If there is any image detected, containing also
```alt``` or ```title``` atribute, the plugin replaces image occurences with the ```figure``` tag, including original
image and additional ```figcaption``` tag with the text read from image attributes.

### Tests
Important part of this plugin is the test suite. You can run the test with command:
```
npm test
```

The test suite includes [JSHint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jshint) validation of the plugin and test suite itself. Then the [Jasmine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-node) tests are executed,
validating expected plugin bahavior. To be sure, that all of the code is covered, [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) generates coverage reports
and sends them to [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/r/todvora/gitbook-plugin-image-captions) service.

The tests are executed with every pushed commit on the [Travis-CI server](https://travis-ci.org/todvora/gitbook-plugin-image-captions).

### Based on
This plugin is based on the example plugin from [GitbookIO/plugin](https://github.com/GitbookIO/plugin).
