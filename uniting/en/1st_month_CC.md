# Your 1st Month as a Club Captain

##Grow: Methods + People + Involvement

Until learning web skills, openness and learner-centric methods are inherent in our educational systems, until collabortion and connectivity are integral parts of our learning pathways, until we can recognize learning no matter where it happens, until people all over the world can read, write to and think critically about information in the global knowledge ecosystem that is the World Wide Web â€“ our work is not done.
We can't expect that someone else, some other organization, some other community to change the world for us. WE have to make commitments to ourselves and each other that we will spread web skills, the open ethos and maker culture in our communities in whatever ways we can.

### Continuing to #TeachTheWeb
Think about all you've done in this #TeachTheWeb experience. Why are you here? Who have you connected with? Why is this interesting to you? What did you learn? Do you want to #TeachTheWeb to people in your community? Do you want to support others by making content or spreading the word? How do you want to be involved in the spread of Web Literacy?

Whether you run a Maker Party or create content for other party hosts to use, whether you talk about the importance of web skills to your networks or research applicable frameworks for teaching the web in public schools, whether you make design assets, write blog posts, donate food or space to people trying to #TeachTheWeb... **There is value to whatever kind of contribution you are willing to make.**

We cannot #TeachTheWeb alone, the task is too great. There is an entire community of people that care about this work and are eager to keep you involved. Be inspired by this amazing community, and make your own commitment to #TeachTheWeb, then share your commitment with the rest of us.
