# Command Line Interface (CLI)
A command line (or 'command prompt') is in many respects the opposite of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The CLI is a terminal window on your device where you can interact with a computer at a more fundamental level than the GUI. An example is the difference between going to a website using a browser to see if it's working, versus sending a [Ping](#ping) via a command line to see if it's available.

# Domain Name System (DNS)
The Domain Name System, or DNS, is the way that **URLs** are translated into **IP addresses**. This allows words, easily understandable by humans, to be converted into numbers, which are more easily understood by computers. 

# Hop
Within a network of computers, a hop is one part of the path a data [packet](#packet) takes between its source and destination. For example, a data packet may be sent from a computer to a router, on to the [ISP](#) and then to the [DNS](#) to be resolved into an [IP address](#). This happens every time a user types in the [URL](#) of a website and connects to the [web server](#) providing the resource. To see how many hops it takes to get from the source to the destination, a [traceroute](#) program can be used.

# Internet Service Provider (ISP)
"An Internet Service Provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet" (Wikipedia). Having a **router** in your home or business allows computers to talk to each other on the **LAN** but to connect to the Internet your router will also need to connect via an ISP.

# Internet Protocol (IP) address
An IP address is a numerical label given to each device on a computer network. This may be your **Local Area Network (LAN)** or the Internet. IP addresses are given to everything from computers to printers to mobile devices such as printers. An example of how these are used is when **routers** send data coming from the internet to the correct device based on its IP address.

# Local Area Network (LAN)
A Local Area Network, or LAN connects devices together within a particular area. For example, if you have a **router** in your home then that has a LAN. These can be more or less complicated; some LANs are huge and cover entire organisations or university campuses.

# Packet
A packet is a formatted unit of data to be sent across a network. Packet-based networks are more efficient than bit-stream networks as packets can be shared among users. Each packet contains two types of data: control information and user data. An example of this would be the URL or IP address of a search engine _(the control information)_ and your search term _(the user data)_.

# Ping
Users and software programs can send a ping to an [IP address](#) on a network. This can be used to judge the speed of a network connection, or to see whether the machine / website / resource at the IP address is currently available. A packet of data is sent between one *IP address* (normally the user's device) and another device on the network (normally a website). If this happens quickly, then the connection is said to have _low latency_. This is important for many types of realtime applications, including online games.

# Remix
A remix is when an existing artefact is taken and altered in some way. This can be done in a very subtle, barely noticeable way, such as when someone takes some text and changes a few words. It can also be done in a dramatic way, for example when several images are combined together using filters and other artistic techniques. Any kind of media can be remixed.

# Router
A router moves data packets between computer networks. The most common example of this is when data coming from the Internet via an **ISP** is sent to a particular device based on its **IP address**

# Traceroute
Traceroute is a diagnostic tool for displaying the route that a **packet** of data has taken across a network. It is useful for finding **hops** and measuring **ping** times between the source and destination.

# Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
A Uniform Resource Locator, or URL, is also known as a web address. This is what you see when you visit a website - for example, [https://mozilla.org](https://mozilla.org). These are translated into **IP addresses** that computers can understand by **DNS**.

# Web Server
A web server is a computer that hosts websites and other services via the Internet.
