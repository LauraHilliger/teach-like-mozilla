## Learn how to #TeachTheWeb.

We want a web that is open, accessible and ours. In order to achieve that, more of us need to understand its basic mechanics, its culture and what it means to be a citizen of the web. **Teach Like Mozilla** is part of Mozilla's commitment to help educators and others teach vital web literacy skills using participatory, learner-centric methodologies. 

We want our teaching to be:

* **Participatory**: Engaging and activating participants from the beginning and getting them making and doing, rather than listening and watching.
* **Purposeful**: Working toward meaningful goals.
* **Productive**: Well-planned so that learning outcomes are achieved in the allotted time, and participants feel time was well spent.
* **Playful**: While our mission is a serious one, the more joy we find in it, the more we'll stick with it and the more people we'll attract to it.

Everything here is **100% free, open source and powered by a global community** of people like you who want to teach digital and web skills in ways that are creative, participatory and fun.

Once you feel like the lessons here are part of your everyday practice, you might be interested in further development through the [Community Education modules](http://education.mozilla-community.org/) which aim to further empower Mozillians in their contributions to the web.
