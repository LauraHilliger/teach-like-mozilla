## Take Action
* **Craft your story.** Why is web literacy important to you? How will your local activities contribute to the change you want to see in the world? Why should people join you? Publish it in Discourse. [Examples can be found here.](http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs/stories)
* **Build a brand for your activities.** We invite you to use our branding, change the name and hack the materials. All of these things become part of your story.
  * **Mission Statement.** Our mission is to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the Web. Does your club have a more specific mission or target audience? Write a few words about what your club intends to do in the world. [Post your story in Discourse.](http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs/stories)
  * **Mozilla branding.** The Mozilla brand helps identify your clubs as part of our global network and mission. Have a look at the [Mozilla branding guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/) for usage rights and templates.
  * **Naming.** We love seeing “Mozilla Clubs” pop up, yet we also welcome adaptations of the name to better represent your community or language. Example club names include: Mozilla Club Toronto, Xavier School Web Club, St. Patricks Church Tech Club or London Library Web Club. You can also embed your club in an existing program or brand.
  * **Communication Channels.** Use open communications as a way to track questions and answers and otherwise document important conversations. Be sure and note on your website how you and your region communicate. We recommend connecting with the global community by using #TeachTheWeb and our [Community Discussion Forum](http://discourse.webmaker.org).
* **Introduce yourself to your peers.** Share your story. Discuss how you want to learn and how your peers can best support you. Give feedback and encouragement to others. [Community Discussion Forum](http://discourse.webmaker.org)
  * **Create Talking Points.** for how your activities will add value to your local community. It is important to talk and write about your initiative using clear, consistent language so that you explain your project accurately. Craft 3-5 sentences that explain the focus, structure and goals of your club or event. Here are some [sample talking points and FAQs](https://p2pu.org/media/uploads/files/LauraHilliger/2012/02/09/HackasaurusTalkingPoints_FAQs.pdf)—feel free to borrow or remix them. Be sure and share with the community and ask for feedback!
* **Spread the Word.** Tell the world what you and your club are doing! Here are ways to show off the hard work that’s put into teaching and learning the web.
  * **Social Media.** Share your club activity online. Write a few sample tweets and posts that your mentors and learners can share on their networks as well. Be sure to share them with us too using #teachtheweb and @Mozteach.
  * **Local Media.** Reach out to local media outlets and tell them what you’re doing. You can tweet or email media outlets, as well as their local reporters who write about similar topics. Remember, you need a good hook. Make it relative to your local clubs and environment, and tell them why what you’re doing matters in your community.
* **Make a Club Infosheet.** Write a blog post or design a special page that has everything in one place and is easy to share. [Check out this example.](https://juliahivenyc.makes.org/thimble/hive-nyc-cohort-guide)

## Grow: Methods + People + Involvement

Online and face-to-face maker communities amplify each other's work and the work of their participants. By sharing what we do in the offline world with our networks in the online world (and vice versa), we create resources, examples and case studies that can help us identify which methods work and how we, as a global community, can support one another.

Until learning web skills, openness and learner-centric methods are inherent in our educational systems, until collaboration and connectivity are integral parts of our learning pathways, until we can recognize learning no matter where it happens, until people all over the world can read, write to and think critically about information in the global knowledge ecosystem that is the World Wide Web – our work is not done. We can't expect that someone else, some other organization, some other community to change the world for us. WE have to make commitments to ourselves and each other that we will spread web skills, the open ethos and maker culture in our communities in whatever ways we can.

## Continuing to #TeachTheWeb
Think about all you've done. Why are you a member of this community? Who have you connected with? Why is this interesting to you? What did you learn? Do you want to #TeachTheWeb to people in your local area? Do you want to support others by making content or spreading the word? How do you want to be involved in the spread of [Web Literacy](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/web-literacy/)?

Whether you run a [Maker Party](http://teach.mozilla.org/events) or create content for other party hosts to use, whether you talk about the importance of web skills to your networks or research applicable frameworks for teaching the web in public schools, whether you design assets, write blog posts, [jump in on curriculum issues](https://github.com/mozilla/learning-networks/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3A%22help+wanted%22), donate food or space to people trying to #TeachTheWeb... There is value to whatever kind of contribution you are willing to make.

There is an entire community of people that care about this work and are eager to keep you involved. Be inspired by this amazing community, and make your own commitment to #TeachTheWeb, then share your commitment with the rest of us.

##Recap
* Creating talking points and a story for how a club/initiative will add value to your peers will help you find collaborators.
* Participating online as well as offline will help strengthen your network.
