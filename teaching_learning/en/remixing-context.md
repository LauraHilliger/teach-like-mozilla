# Remixing for Context (Making it Relevant)

##Take Action
* **Decide who you want to serve.** If you've worked through the Making IS Learning module, you've already thought about the learners you ultimately want to benefit. What do learners need and what can you do for them? [Share your learner profile.](http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/training/building)
* Using your insights to you learnersâ€™ aspirations, **remix lesson plans** to speak to individual audiences. The Web Literacy module introduces this concept, but read on for more guidance on how you can change an activity or resource to better suit your learners and your context.
* **Choose a date and publish an invitation** for your event. Meet in-person. Make sure you have a chance to meet with your peers to establish your club. Discuss the remixed curriculum, what the schedule will look like and what parts of the learning will need the most support. Each team member should know what is expected of them so they are poised to give their best effort.
* **Meet Online.** Using open tools you can set up regular checkins and share outs.

## What do we mean by 'remix'?
As we define in the Glossary, to 'remix' something is to take something that exists and make something new out of it. This can be a small change, or you could transform it beyond all recognition.

## Why should I remix?
Context is extremely important to learners, especially if they're showing up for something that isn't compulsory. An easy way to make something fun and exciting is to remix it in order to make it applicable to their everyday lives - or something they care deeply about.

Remixing other people's work also allows you to make it better. You can stand on the shoulders of others who are interested in similar outcomes to you. Instead of starting from scratch, you can get a head-start by using and building upon their work.

## How do I get started remixing?
There are many ways to create your first remix. Let's use the example of the [Reading the Web: Credibility](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session01-kraken.html) session (itself a remix of MOUSE's [Kraken the Code](https://katermouse.makes.org/thimble/LTc4OTExODk3Ng==/kraken-the-code-activity) activity).

This activity asks learners to investigate whether or not a "Kraken", a legendary sea creature, is real or fictional. Sometimes details within a piece of curriculum are not appropriate for your audience, but you can replace it with a different research topic. Some ideas:

* Make the context appropriate for your organization type. For example:
** GLAM: Are all the best paintings really stored in the basement of the Louvre?
** After School: Would a real Nigerian prince ever email you?
** Community: Are unicorns real?
** University: Does our school have a secret society?
* Do a Topical Remix:
** History: Could you rent a pineapple in England during the 19th century?
** Geography: Is Shangri-La real or fictional?
** Biology: Can humans have webbed feet?

We would love to know how you remix Club activities! Please share your ideas with the global community.
