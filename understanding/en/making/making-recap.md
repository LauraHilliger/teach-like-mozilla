##Recap
* When we make we learn through trial and error and the ever important failure. We learn what to do and what not to do.
* Connected Learning is an interest-based, peer supported, academically oriented framework that can help you design collaborative projects and programs.
* The Web is a massive, shifting repository of human knowledge.
* Web Literacy is the skills and competencies needed for reading, writing, and participating on the Web.
* We should empower learners to engage this ecosystem *and* make the Web they want to use.
* Mozilla developed the [Web Literacy Map](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/web-literacy/) to help you do just that.
