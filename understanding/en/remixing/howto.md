## How to Remix

There are many ways to create your first remix. Let's use the example of the [Reading the Web: Credibility](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session01-kraken.html) session (itself a remix of MOUSE's [Kraken the Code](https://katermouse.makes.org/thimble/LTc4OTExODk3Ng==/kraken-the-code-activity) activity).

This activity asks learners to investigate whether or not a "Kraken", a legendary sea creature, is real or fictional. Sometimes details within a piece of curriculum are not appropriate for your audience, but you can replace it with a different research topic. Some ideas:

* Make the context appropriate for your organization type. For example:
** GLAM: Are all the best paintings really stored in the basement of the Louvre?
** After School: Would a real Nigerian prince ever email you?
** Community: Are unicorns real?
** University: Does our school have a secret society?
* Do a Topical Remix:
** History: Could you rent a pineapple in England during the 19th century?
** Geography: Is Shangri-La real or fictional?
** Biology: Can humans have webbed feet?

We would love to know how you remix Club activities! Please share your ideas with the global community.
