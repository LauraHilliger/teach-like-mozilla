##Take Action

<div class="well example">
	<ul>
		<li><p><strong>Set up a web presence and use the #TeachTheWeb hashtag to reflect on your progress in the open.</strong> Introducing yourself and developing the habit of publishing about your work will connect you with your peers, document your progress and expand your network.</p>

<p>You might want to consider creating a site where club captains can showcase what their learners make, while potential learners can get a feel for what happens. <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> and <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> are all easy and free places to start. Discourse is our town hall, join us and share the link to your new web home on <a href="http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/training/exploring">our discussion forum</a>.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Set up Mailing Lists.</strong> It can be helpful to have a way to push information at a specific group of people, a mailing list will help you do that. There are plenty of free services on the web, Google Groups are particularly easy to set up.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Set up a section in Discourse to reflect regularly on your progress.</strong> Read and respond to others in the community. What are the challenges you are facing? Where do you need help? <a href="http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/training/exploring">Publish your progress.</a></p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Think about other ways you will share with your peers.</strong> Share the website with the community and get feedback, promote your work in social media channels, ask the community what works for them.</p></li>
	</ul>
