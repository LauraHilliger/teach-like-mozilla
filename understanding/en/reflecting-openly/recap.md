## Recap
* Openness is about working collaboratively and decentralized in a transparent manner and assigning licenses that allow for remixing and hackability.
* Openness can be tricky because it means there are a lot of stakeholders, but innovation thrives in this environment.
* A remix creates a derivative work from an original, and building on top of someone elseâ€™s work is possible through open licensing.
