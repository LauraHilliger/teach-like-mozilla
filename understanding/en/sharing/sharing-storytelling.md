## Take Action
* **Craft your story.** Why is web literacy important to you? How will your local activities contribute to the change you want to see in the world? Why should people join you? Publish it in Discourse. [Examples can be found here.](http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs/stories)
* **Build a brand for your activities.** We invite you to use our branding, change the name and hack the materials. All of these things become part of your story.
  * **Mission Statement.** Our mission is to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the Web. Does your club have a more specific mission or target audience? Write a few words about what your club intends to do in the world. [Post your story in Discourse.](http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs/stories)
  * **Mozilla branding.** The Mozilla brand helps identify your clubs as part of our global network and mission. Have a look at the [Mozilla branding guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/) for usage rights and templates.
  * **Naming.** We love seeing “Mozilla Clubs” pop up, yet we also welcome adaptations of the name to better represent your community or language. Example club names include: Mozilla Club Toronto, Xavier School Web Club, St. Patricks Church Tech Club or London Library Web Club. You can also embed your club in an existing program or brand.
  * **Communication Channels.** Use open communications as a way to track questions and answers and otherwise document important conversations. Be sure and note on your website how you and your region communicate. We recommend connecting with the global community by using #TeachTheWeb and our [Community Discussion Forum](http://discourse.webmaker.org).
* **Introduce yourself to your peers.** Share your story. Discuss how you want to learn and how your peers can best support you. Give feedback and encouragement to others. [Community Discussion Forum](http://discourse.webmaker.org)
  * **Create Talking Points.** for how your activities will add value to your local community. It is important to talk and write about your initiative using clear, consistent language so that you explain your project accurately. Craft 3-5 sentences that explain the focus, structure and goals of your club or event. Here are some [sample talking points and FAQs](https://p2pu.org/media/uploads/files/LauraHilliger/2012/02/09/HackasaurusTalkingPoints_FAQs.pdf)—feel free to borrow or remix them. Be sure and share with the community and ask for feedback!
* **Spread the Word.** Tell the world what you and your club are doing! Here are ways to show off the hard work that’s put into teaching and learning the web.
  * **Social Media.** Share your club activity online. Write a few sample tweets and posts that your mentors and learners can share on their networks as well. Be sure to share them with us too using #teachtheweb and @Mozteach.
  * **Local Media.** Reach out to local media outlets and tell them what you’re doing. You can tweet or email media outlets, as well as their local reporters who write about similar topics. Remember, you need a good hook. Make it relative to your local clubs and environment, and tell them why what you’re doing matters in your community.
* **Make a Club Infosheet.** Write a blog post or design a special page that has everything in one place and is easy to share. [Check out this example.](https://juliahivenyc.makes.org/thimble/hive-nyc-cohort-guide)
